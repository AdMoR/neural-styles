TODO :

- Make alexnet work on logit value --> mismatch on size
- Have functional regularization --> gaussian blur, bilateral filtering
- verify : jitter and crop

- Add proper layer naming retrieval


Transformation : 

Images were optimized for 2560 steps in a color-decorrelated fourier-transformed space, using Adam at a learning rate of 0.05. We used each of following transformations in the given order at each step of the optimization:

• Padding the input by 16 pixels to avoid edge artifacts
• Jittering by up to 16 pixels
• Scaling by a factor randomly selected from this list: 1, 0.975, 1.025, 0.95, 1.05
• Rotating by an angle randomly selected from this list; in degrees: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
• Jittering a second time by up to 8 pixels
• Cropping the padding


Notes : 
jitter too large --> unstable training and get a black image back
